CarShippingWebsite
==================

After a brutally painful experience trying to ship a vehicle to Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. I decided to throw a web solution at the problems I faced.
I hope this will help the shipping agents start offering a transparent service and better experience to **new customers.** 
This solution offers an alternative from where the problems starts, the agent **website** and I hope it's where the solution should begin.
